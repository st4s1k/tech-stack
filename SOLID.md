1. Single Responsibility
	- A class should have only **one responsibility**, therefore only **one reason to change**
2. Open/Closed
		- **Open** for **extension**
		- **Closed** for **modification**
3. Liskov substitution
	- If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks **like a duck - is not necessarily a duck**
4. Interface Segregation
	- Avoid throwing or empty interface method implementations
	- The interface shouldn't force the class to implement methods it doesn't need
1. Dependency Inversion
	- **Depend on abstract interfaces instead of specific classes**, this way it will be easier to substitute or modify existing code - **decoupling**
