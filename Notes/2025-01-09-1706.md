Started an obsidian notebook to gather all the knowledge in one place the way I like it and the way I understand it. There's a shit ton of information and I am not sure I have enough time and mental energy to learn it all. The discrepancy between the reality of the everyday job and the interview knowledge requirements is pissing me off. Still. Looking forward to learn something new, maybe even interesting. Who knows, maybe it will be useful for an interview in another company in the (near?) future.

Reddit comments on the requirements for the competency of a senior developer don't seem like something you'll be asked at a job interview:
